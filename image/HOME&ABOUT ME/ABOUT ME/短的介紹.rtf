My name is Una Chang, born in 2003 in New Taipei City, Taiwan, a designer with a calm and composed demeanor. I have a special fondness for quirky and cute little things and believe that good design brings joy to people. Becoming a designer has been my first and only career dream. Through my work, I hope to show everyone the beauty of the world.}
